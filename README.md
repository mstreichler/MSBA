# Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)
The projects in this repository include the assignments completed during my one year Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) program at The University of Texas at Austin.

Below is a list of the documents in this GitHub repository and a description of what each assignment is.
AM Project
This project was for my fall semester class titled Asset Management. The course was structured to teach students asset management in a quantitative manner. The instructions for this assignment was to create an investment strategy and backtest data. For this project, we constructed a statistical arbitrage.

### APM Project
This project was for my fall semester class titled Advanced Predictive Modeling. The course was structured to teach students the advanced predictive and classification models and regressions. The instructions for this assignment was to investigate any dataset and try to solve a problem of our choice. For this assignment, we analyzed customer browsing patterns on Expedia to predict which hotel cluster they will book. The assignment was based on a past Kaggle Competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/expedia-hotel-recommendations). We then had to do a blog write up of the entire project (https://petedavis22.medium.com/seo-search-expedia-optimization-779d728b1374).

#### Asset_Management_HW2
This project was for my fall semester class titled Asset Management. The course was structured to teach students asset management in a quantitative manner. The instructions for this assignment was to analyze small cap value funds based on their returns in relation to fund size.

##### Final Code
This project was for my fall semester class titled Introduction to Data Management. The course was structured to teach students the basics of SQL. For this project we had to select a real world company, create three transaction management applications along with a data warehouse, and select a subset of the data to analyze any market trends.

###### HW1
This project was for my fall semester class titled Empirical Finance. The course was structured to teach students to run regressions on CAPM and multi-factor models. The instructions for this assignment was to explore whether past sales growth explains future abnormal stock returns.

### HW1_Asset_Management
This project was for my fall semester class titled Asset Management. The course was structured to teach students asset management in a quantitative manner. The instructions for this assignment was to replicate the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average Indices and to compare the replications with the actual index and a passive ETF and Mutual Fund.

### HW1_Text Analysis
This project was for my fall semester class titled Text Analysis. The course was structured to teach students how to scrape and analyze real time, unstructured data. For this project, we had to analyze car brands and associated attributes and characteristics through Lift Analysis.

### MIS 381N – Project
This project was for my summer semester class titled Data Analytics Programming. The course was structured to teach students the basics of Python and Pandas. The instructions for this assignment was to investigate any dataset and try to solve a problem of our choice. The problem that I tried to solve was to accurately predict whether or not a patient in the Pima Indian heritage has diabetes. The dataset (pima_diabetes.csv) was taken from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

### Project
This project was for my summer semester class titled Predictive Modeling. The course was structured to teach students the basics of R. The instructions for this assignment was to find an interesting prediction/classification problem and develop the best possible predictive algorithm for the variable of interest. For this assignment, we constructed a model to forecast actual house sale prices in Ames, IA.

STA Final
This project was for my summer semester class titled Predictive Modeling. The course was structured to teach students the basics of R. This assignment consisted of six different exercises:

    1. Visual Story Telling Part 1 - Green Buildings: Understand the financial returns on environmentally friendly buildings through the use of visualizations
    2. Visual Story Telling Part 2 - Flights at ABIA: Create a set of related figures that tells an interesting story about flights into and out of Austin Bergstrom International Airport
    3. Portfolio Modeling: Create three portfolios and generate returns and other insights from the data
    4. Market Segmentation: Analyze data to prepare a report identifying any interesting market segments
    5. Author Attribution: Predict the author of an article on the basis of an article's textual content
    6. Association Rule Mining: Find interesting association rules for shopping baskets

### Text Analysis HW3
This project was for my fall semester class titled Text Analysis. The course was structured to teach students how to scrape and analyze real time, unstructured data. For this project, we extracted images and captions from Zara's instagram page to analyze user engagement.

### Text_Analysis_Project
This project was for my fall semester class titled Text Analysis. The course was structured to teach students how to scrape and analyze real time, unstructured data. For this project, we scraped Twitter data to determine if iPhone or Android users are switching phones.

### Text_Analytics_HW2
This project was for my fall semester class titled Text Analysis. The course was structured to teach students how to scrape and analyze real time, unstructured data. For this project, we constructed a beer recommendation system based on user defined attributes. For the recommendation system, we performed Cosine Similarity and feature-level Analyses to capture similar beers influenced by user reviews’ sentiment and rankings.
